numbers System - binary - decimal - hexadeciaml

hexadecimal is shorthand for binary

4 bits are called nibble.

1 byte has two nibbles.

we can represent each nibble in hexadecimal.

so two hexadecimal characters for a byte.

KB -> 2^10  1024 bytes
MB -> 2^20  10 48 576 bytes
GB -> 2^30  1 07 37 41 824 bytes

units of memory -CPU

byte       
word           - 2 byte
double word    - 4 byte
quad word      - 8 byte
paragraph      - 16 byte

. The CPU can access data in registers much faster than data in memory. 
. However, the number of registers in a CPU is limited.
. so the programmer must take care to keep only currently used data in registers.

computers uses a clock to synchronize the execution of the instruction.

1 GHZ - 1 BILLION cycles per second

pentium introuduces MMX instructions makes common graphics faster.


ESI  EDI  ESP  EBP  --> cannot be used as 8 bit

. One of definitions of the term word refers to the size of the data registers of the CPU. 

. In protected mode, a selector value is an index into a descriptor table. 

. An assembler is a program that reads a text file with assembly instructions and converts the assembly into machine code. Compilers are programs
  that do similar conversions for high-level programming languages.

. One restriction is that both operands of a instruction may not be memory operands. 

. The operands must also be the same size.

. A directive is an artifact of the assembler not the CPU. 

. They are not translated into machine code. 

EQU directive is used to create a symbol

byte        B
word        W
double word D
quad word   Q
ten bytes   T

Macros are more flexible than symbols in two ways. Macros can be redefined and can be more than simple constant numbers.

Data directives are used in data segments to define room for memory.
